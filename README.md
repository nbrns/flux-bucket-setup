# Flux Bucket Setup

The idea of this repository is to run [FluxCD](https://fluxcd.io/) without a git server but the [Bucket Source](https://fluxcd.io/docs/components/source/buckets/). This means, Flux bootstrapping also takes place via the Bucket Source. This allows local setups of Flux without a running git server.
